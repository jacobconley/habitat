Habitat
======

Habitat is more-or-less a web framework for the Go programming language, 
though that feels like an overstatement.
Mainly, it is a simple configuration of the [Buffalo](https://github.com/gobuffalo) and [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla) ecosystem, 
along with some other crucial packages for a modern web development environment (who will all be properly thanked in a SHOULDERS.md soon),
and a few original features to tie the whole thing together.  

More to come!
